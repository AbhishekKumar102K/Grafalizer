# Graph Visualizer
A tool for visualizing graphs (weighted/unweighted and directed/undirected) using the React.js framework. 

**How to Use**
1) Add nodes by clicking anywhere on the canvas
2) For adding edges, click on source node followed by target node. (Order does not matter in case of undirected edges)
3) For adding weights to edges, click anywhere on the edge and type in the weight value
